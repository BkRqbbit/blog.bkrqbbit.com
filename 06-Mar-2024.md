# The beginning...

## Introduction

I'm a computer sistems engineer at ESCOM IPN.\
Nowadays, my student status is complicated.\
Due to different familiar and financial problems, I'm having trouble with my university journey.\
At this point, I'm afraid that I'll need to drop out of school, just to stabilize the situation at home.

Is it worth? Sacrifice one of your biggest dreams, for the good of your family?\
Of course it is, I know that there are different ways to become a software developer.\
So I won't just give up. I know I would not be able to have a formal eduction.\
But it is not the end of the world!\
Even if I couldn't get my title, I'll then become a self-taught developer.

Today is the first day I dedicate (purposefully) to become a better version of me.\
I will dedicate some time to study and learn the stuff needed to become a top software developer.

At this point of my life, I know a lot of stuff about the tech field.\
But I do prefer to kind of "forgot" about them and study the basis.\
This is just for the purpose of documenting the journey till I get a software development position.

This first entry of my blog, is an introduction about my life.\
It will not contain every single detail of my life, but I'll share a bit more as we continue in the journey.

## About the blog
This blog, will be both for personal development, and my growth as a software developer.\
In the beginning, I will publish a .md file into the site (blog,bkrqbbit.com)\
I'll be focused on becoming a web developer, and each time I learn somehting new that can be useful for the blog, I'll add it to build a robust site.\
Just for you to know, that the blog won't be purely of web development.

I consider myself a backend developer.\
At this point, one of my most powerful programming lanugages is C.\
So you can wait for interesting projects about operating systems, and engineering stuff.

Each entry will have a table of contents so you can choose what you want to read about.\
The content won't be like an article, organized and divided into sections.\
Each entry will contain what I do into my every day life (like a diary).\
Every interesting topic that I learn and I consider that deserves a formal entry, will be published at (www.bkrqbbit.com) unless I decide to change the location (every change will be announced here in the blog, and on my twitter account @WR_Stdnt)

## Goal
The goal is not to get a software development position in a couple days or even months.\
I'm trying to be realistic and I expect this journey to be a long path to travel.

I work everyday like around 10-14 hours, so as you might expect, it is difficult.\
There are days where I don't wan't to do anything but rest.\
But this "project" was created to change that.\
I don't like how my future looks like at this point.\
So what I'm trying to do, is to change it!

## About the day
I'm not a big fan of web development, but I still like it.\
Nowadays the web plays an important role in modern society.\
Learning web development will allow me to build interesting projects, and develop this blog!\
That way, I can offer a better experience to all the readers here!

So everything big, needs to start with a small change.\
That's why I've decided to learn HTML by watching a udemy course I bought some time ago.\
Why not taking advantage of something I did put money into?

## HTML Learning Notes
In order to be able to create web pages, there is a set of tools that we need to install in our computer.\
First, a web browser: It will render the code we write, into a web page content.\
And second, a text editor: We will use it to write the code of our web pages!

You can use any web browser that you want, but the best option you have is to use a popular one.\
The same applies for the text editor, almost any software can help you to complete the task that is to write the code of your webpage.

HTML files must have the `.html` or `.htm` extension.\
Both work the same way, so you can choose the one that you prefer.

## Daily discoveries
Some years ago, I used to study for long periods of time.\
Now that I've decided to take back to study, I can notice how hard it is to stay focused.\
ALso, feeling tired / fatigued is common.\
Now, here is a key area to improve!

Time studied: 1 hour\
I'll definitely be working into increasing the amount of time.\
Time management is also on the list!
