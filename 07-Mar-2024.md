# Implementation and improvement
Today is the second day in the path to change my life.\
Yesterday was more a day of reflection and planning.\
A day where I think of what I want to achieve, and set a path to achieve it.

I noticed that the habits and behaviours that I have, are not the ones that my best version would have.\
For example, when I feel overwhelmed or a bit tired and want to rest, all I do is to scroll trough social media.\
And as you asume, there is not space for resting.\
When I get back to my activities, I feel even worse, and can't concentrate on the task at hand.

Another problem, is procrastination.\
I found myself multiple times over wasting time that is not even necessary.\
A task that would perfectly take 30mins, is extended to almost 2 hours...

These are the primarily problems, but they are not the only ones.\
I'll be reflecting, and trying to fix them!

## Goal #1
I've readed different kind of content related to the stoic philosophy, and one thing that I can remember, is that there was a person (I don't remember the name) that take a few minutes to reflect over his day during night, make some anotations of what he can improve, and in the next day, that was something he was working on to fix.

I know I am a human, which means I'm not perfect.\
But also means that there'is room for improvement.\
I'm going to take that opportunity, and enjoy mi time here in life.

This blogs are like my diary, I take notes of what I do, what I think, and many stuff more.\
I will read this during the night, and be aware of my faults.\
Medidtate over them and seek for a way to improve.

I want a better life for myself and the ones that I love.

## Goal #2
I don't actually use social media apps for communication (not all of them).\
Most of the time I find myself navigating trough a social media, is to waste time (enterteinment).\
That's not a good way to use my time, and instead of just avoiding the app, I will left no option to use this.\
This is why I've decided to delete my social media apps (facebook, instagram, tiktok).

There are other apps that I actually use for learning, or comunnication!\
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't leave them (there are severe concequences).

Most of that apps, have important information saved.\
I'll save most of that, but slowly to avoid the app as most as I can.\
Once the vaiuable stuff is saved into my pc, I'll surely delete social media apps!

## Note #1
Today I found myself many times procrastinating.\
You might be thinking that this is bad, but actually noticing it is a good start.\
I know that this is something not good, and I stop doing it.\
It don't take me much time to notice it, it is in a margin of 10 minutes.
